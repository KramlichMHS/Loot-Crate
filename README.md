# Loot Crate

***Directions***: Create a program that will unbox a ‘loot crate’ from a video game. Your code will have to output an item from the loot crate. All items will fall into 1 of 5 categories: *Common*, *Uncommon*, *Rare*, *Epic*, and *Legendary*. The odds for obtaining the each level of rarity are as follows:

> Common - 50%  
> Uncommon - 25%  
> Rare - 15%  
> Epic - 8%  
> Legendary - 2%

Once the rarity of the item in the loot box has been chosen, your code must then output the name of a specific item from that category (Minimum of 3 per level of rarity)(Get creative with your names for items!). For example, if your loot crate opened as Legendary, then your code would have to randomly choose to output The Sword of a Thousand Truths, The Hammer of Forged Lightning, or The Wand of Forsaking Whispers.


Example Outputs for a Golfing Game:  

> You have received Bent-Out-of-Shape Putter - Common  
> You have received Top Notch 3 Wood - Rare  
> You have received Golden Driver- Legendary  

Example Outputs for an RPG:

> You have received Unsharpened Stick - Common  
> You have received Sturdy Oak Bow - Rare  
>You have received Frostmourne - Legendary  

**80%** - All of the above

**90%** - All of the above and ask the user how many crates they would like to open and ask if they would like to open more crates after they have already opened some.

**100%** - All of the above and allow the user to select a tier of crate they would like to open.  

For example the basic tier has the following odds: 
> Common - 50%  
> Uncommon - 25%  
> Rare - 15%  
> Epic - 8%  
> Legendary - 2%  

While a premium tier might have better odds for higher end items (this is an example of the odds for a premium crate, you can choose your own odds):
> Common - 20%  
> Uncommon -20%  
> Rare - 30%  
> Epic -20%  
> Legendary - 10%

**Bonus** - Use the [colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/) python module to add color to your items to show their rarity!
